# What is the pair coding?

The __"Pair Coding"__ or __"Pair Programming"__ is an agile technique that originates from extreme programming (XP) in which two developers come together and work at a workstation to design, code and test user stories. One, the __driver__, writes code while the other, the observer or __navigator__, reviews each line of code as it is written while providing tactical and analytical feedback. The observer considers the "strategic" direction of the work, presenting ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. And the two programmers change roles frequently.

This methodology is presented in __3 other styles__, in addition to the driver-browser:

1. Backseat Navigator: This style is similar to the controller-navigator, but the navigator assumes more of the tactical roles of the driver. In backseat navigation, the controller continues to control the keyboard and typing, but the browser dictates syntactic instructions, such as what name to call a variable or what specific method to call. The rear seat navigator style works best with a beginner as a driver and an expert as a navigator, allowing the beginner to learn by doing.

2. Ping Pong Pairing: Another style of pair programming that is often used in development is ping pong pairing. In this pattern, the first person writes a test that is currently failing and the second person gets the test to pass. Then the second person writes a failed test and the first person gets it to pass.

    The benefits of ping pong matchmaking are that it allows roles to change frequently and forces engineers to pay attention to the coding and testing aspects of development, gaining familiarity with TDD in the process.

3. Pomodoro: The Pomodoro matchmaking style is similar to ping-pong match, but prescribes set time intervals for each session. A typical Pomodoro-style matchmaking session lasts 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. The controller and the browser change positions. After four 25-minute sessions, both programmers take a longer 20-minute break. Forced breaks and regular position change help ensure both programmers are always productive, focused, and up-to-date when a session begins.

While it is true that this trend or methodology raises doubts, only those who have been able to apply it are those who can offer a positive or negative comment on said methodology.
Some will be in favor and give some of the following arguments:
- Increases productivity.
- Programmers learn to work as a team.
- Communication flows more often and more efficiently.
- Continuous peer learning is created and it is easier for a new team member to quickly get to work and get to know the environment.

While others might have the following negative opinions about pair programming:
- Two programmers work together much faster than one alone, but not faster than two programmers working separately.
- Increase costs (Human resource).
- Problems with each other may slow down your results.

In conclusion I must say that now that I have to use this technique it has seemed quite enjoyable since I can socialize with people I did not know and learn from them or share a little of what I know with them and help each other to meet the objectives of the matter.
